      <h1>Control of 1D kinematics sim</h1>
      <p>A classic PID controller was chosen to control the provided 1D kinematics simulation; The following is the small journey that was used to manually tune the controller</p>
    </header>

    <h2>Tuning the classic PID</h2>
    <p> A simple process was followed to tune the controller. The general process is known as bracketing or rule of halfs. I start by isolating P, the PD, the PID terms. The first goal is to identify the domain in which P and D are reasonable, I start with a random value and march by 1e1 or 1e-1 steps until behavior appears to be reasonable.</p>

      <h3>Zero gains</h3>
      <p>What does our system look like with no control?</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Random initial guess at P (kP = 0.1)</h3>
      <p><b>Observation:</b> Afer making a random guess we can see that we are completely saturating our ouput signal, time to march down the P gains values by 1e-1 until we find something less insane</p>
      <iframe width="95%" height="1000px" src="plots/p_0.1.html"></iframe>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Begin hunting for P (kP = 0.01)</h3>
      <p><b>Observation:</b> Looks like this gets us close! No actuator saturation, and we reach our setpoint with no major oscillations! Time to begin bringing in the other terms.</p>
      <iframe width="95%" height="1000px" src="plots/p_0.01.html"></iframe>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Time to bring in the D term (kP = 0.01, kD = 0.1)</h3>
      <p><b>Observation:</b> Uh oh, maybe a bit too aggressive on the D term. We brought in quit a bit more noise to out output signal and seem to be totally dampening out the P term.</p>
      <iframe width="95%" height="1000px" src="plots/d_0.1.html"></iframe>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Begin hunting for D (kp = 0.01; kD = 0.01)</h3>
      <p><b>Observation:</b> Ahh here we go! Now we are providing some shaping control to the P term, but we are definitely critically underperforming with the P term, let's bring that up.</p>
      <iframe width="95%" height="1000px" src="plots/p_0.01-d_0.01.html"></iframe>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Time to scale P back up (kp = 0.05; kD = 0.01)</h3>
      <p><b>Observation:</b> Back to a similar position before the D term was introduced, looks like we will need to raise these in tandom to get the response we are after!</p>
      <iframe width="95%" height="1000px" src="plots/p_0.05-d_0.01.html"></iframe>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Looks like the D term can follow (kp = 0.075; kD = 0.1)</h3>
      <p><b>Observation:</b> Yes! this is the balance we are looking for, no over shoot and enters into a nice steady state. The D term noise seems under control too! Now we just need to tackle that steady state offset!</p>
      <iframe width="95%" height="1000px" src="plots/p_0.075-d_0.1.html"></iframe>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Begin hunting for I (kp = 0.075; kD = 0.1; kI = 0.01)</h3>
      <p><b>Observation:</b> Close! We are probably a bit too strong on the I term looks like we have some wind-up which drives us past the setpoint, and fights us from getting back.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Finalize the gains (kp = 0.075; kD = 0.1; kI = 0.0015)</h3>
      <p><b>Observation:</b> There we go! Now we are tracking our setpoint quite well! Only thing left to do would be to really understand our model better to see if we missed out!</p>
